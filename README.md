- define a model to work with, using simple JS class syntax
- automatic schema-backing and validation

- tell the model manager which storage system to use (required)
- Either create new models, or load them from storage
- values are automatically validated during creation/assignment
- simple save mechanism (data is by definition valid, default values are not stored)
